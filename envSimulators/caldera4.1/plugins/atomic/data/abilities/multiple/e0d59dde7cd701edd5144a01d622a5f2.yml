- description: 'Requesting a TGT on a remote system and retrieving it locally before
    requesting a service ticket with it. This is a Pass-The-Ticket attack because
    the TGT is obtained on the remote system, then used from a different machine (local).

    PsExec is used to execute commands on the remote system, and the "C$" admin share
    is used to retrieve the TGT, so the current user must have admin rights remotely
    and other PsExec prerequisites must be met.
