- description: Gpg4win is a Windows tool (also called Kleopatra which is the preferred
    certificate manager) that uses email and file encryption packages for symmetric
    encryption. It is used by attackers to encrypt disks. User will need to add pass
    phrase to encrypt file as automation is not allowed under newer versions.
